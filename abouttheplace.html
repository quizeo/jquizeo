		DESCRIPTION:The Bohol man-made forest is the first and only man-made <br>forest in the Philippines. It is mainly composed of Mahogany trees about <br>2 kilometers stretched densely in towns of Bilar and Loboc. <br>
<br>
LOCATION: It is 5 minutes away from Simply Butterflies Conservation Center and 20 <br>minutes away from Tagbilaran City, the lone City of Bohol. Before entering <br>the Bohol man-made forest, one can see the variety of trees and giant ferns <br>along the road.<br>
<br>
The Bohol man-made forest has been one of the many tourist attractions in the <br>Philippines. It stands out because of its uniformity in height, the spread of the<br> branches and the thickness of the leaves. The tidy road and forest make it<br> very relaxing to Bohol trippers. Both locals and tourists stay for 30 minutes to<br> 1 hour to breathe the fresh air and hear the natural sounds of birds and <br>trees. The splendid view and the wonderful erectile order of the Bohol man-made <br>forest makes it very attractive to travelers.<br>
<br>
Nature preservation is one of the main activities of the Bohol Government and one<br> of the things they are proud of is preserving the Bohol man-made forest. When<br> you enter the 2 km dense forest, you can feel the sudden change in <br>temperature and the freshness of the air. This is very noticeable in the summer <br>season from March to June where the humidity in the Philippines is crazy. When<br> you are in this mountainous area you will rarely see the sun and once you see<br> it you still donâ€™t feel the entire heat due to the shades from the branches<br> and leaves. The roots are protruded from the ground and one can sit and eat <br>some snacks there. Just be careful of some lizards or ants that might crawl to <br>you.<br>
<br>
In the road-side, middle part of the Bohol man-made forest, a shelter is provided<br> for visitors to cook and eat their snacks. On our trip, we brought a handy<br> stove and tempura for snacks. Watching those who are hiking through the woods <br>and seeing the mountain bikers on the asphalted road are other things to do in<br> the place. The Bohol man-made forest is part of the main road used by vans, <br>buses, public and private transport to access the different areas of Bohol.<br>
<br>
Before entering the long and winding road of Bohol man-made forest, one will be<br> able to pass the town of Loboc where the popular Loboc River and Floating <br>Restaurant is situated. After the 2 kilometer forest, one will pass the towns of<br> Bilar where the Butterfly Sanctuary is located, then Batuan Town and then <br>Carmen where the world-class Chocolate Hills are seen.<br>
<br>
Bohol man-made forest is an extreme work of art. The magnificent efforts of these <br>world-class Filipinos who started this brilliant nature preservation activity <br>will definitely help make the Earth a better place to live in. We hope that <br>even in the midst of Global modernization, nature preservers will never stop<br> what they love to do.<br>
